# Mobile-Phone-Decision-Support-System

The project, conducted as part of the Decision Support Systems course, aimed to develop a decision support system (DSS) to assist users in selecting the most suitable mobile phone based on their profiles. Utilizing Herbert Simon's decision-making model, the project integrated phases of Intelligence, Design, Choice, and Implementation to build a robust and user-centered system.

The DSS was developed using the DecisionRules platform, which allowed for the creation and management of business rules based on user-specific variables, such as age, financial condition, technology enthusiasm, and sustainability concerns. The system categorized phones into user profiles and provided tailored recommendations. Notable examples included recommendations for older adults seeking simplicity, gamers requiring high performance, and environmentally conscious individuals needing sustainable devices.

During the testing phase, the system proved effective in adapting to diverse user profiles, ensuring personalized recommendations. The project also simulated real-world implementation through interactive interfaces developed using Streamlit. These interfaces demonstrated how users could input their preferences and receive recommendations, while organizations could analyze customer data to identify trends and optimize inventory.

The project successfully applied theoretical knowledge to a practical context, showcasing the potential of DSS tools like DecisionRules in solving real-world problems. It highlighted the importance of structured methodologies in decision-making and the value of aligning technical solutions with user needs.
